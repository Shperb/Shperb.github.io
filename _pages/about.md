I am a Ph.D. student in the [Computer Science department](https://in.bgu.ac.il/en/natural_science/cs/Pages/default.aspx) at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, under the supervision of [Prof. Solomon Eyal Shimony](https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~shimony/). My main research area is decision-making under uncertainty, while focusing on applying reasoning at the meta-level (<em>meta-reasoning</em>), and on computing and utilizing <em>value of information</em>. My secondary research area is <em>heuristic search</em>, particularly in <em>bidirectional  heuristic search</em>.
