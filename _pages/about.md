I am a Ph.D. student in the [Computer Science department](https://in.bgu.ac.il/en/natural_science/cs/Pages/default.aspx) at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, under the supervision of [Prof. Solomon Eyal Shimony](https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~shimony/). My main research area is <em>decision-making under uncertainty</em>, while focusing on applying <em>meta-level techniques</em> to different problem settings in the fields of planning, search, and scheduling. These meta-level techniques are applied to existing algorithms and frameworks in single-agent and multi-agent environments in order to improve their performance. In general, these meta-level technique are based on learning a probability model suited for the given problem and reasoning to improve the decision making. By developing and applying meta-level techniques a substantial improvement in performance was achieved in my work on different settings, compared to the original algorithms to which these techniques were applied. My secondary research area is <em>heuristic search</em>, particularly in <em>bidirectional  heuristic search</em>.
