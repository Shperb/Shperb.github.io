Course Info
======
This course is about implementing a software
engineering project, using SE methodologies and
principles taught in other courses, and using
modern software technologies. The course
functions as an SE-lab, where the students cope
with a demanding SE task in a guided manner.
The lab mimics a natural SE-development task,
where usage of SE procedures is valuable and
productive. It embodies the following features:
* Adopt an agile development approach.
* Maintenance challenges: Create a natural
environment of successive changes due to
complex evolution.
* Enable a thoughtful non-na√Øve customer
(course staff), that plan intentionally complex
requirements.
* Insist on product validation.
* Enforce SE-systematic development, including
models, validation, testing, requirements
analysis and reliability.
* Cope with technology challenges.
* Structured teamwork.
The goal of the lab is to acquire experience in
using SE methodologies, methods and
technologies.
management, bug tracking, unit testing, and
version control.
The students in the course are organized in small
student groups. All groups implement the
software project which is the course theme.
Within a group, the members take alternating
roles as version leader, developer, and tester. The
course staff takes the role of the customers,
providing an initial requirement document. Each
group has a staff member that functions as its
advisor. The group meets its advisor once in two
weeks, for a 2 hour long meeting. In that meeting
the group presents its development for the current
version, and one group member presents a topic
that is relevant for the next version.
